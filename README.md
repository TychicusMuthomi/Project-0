# Day 7 Python Project - Simple Calculator

This is a simple Python calculator program I created on Day 7 of my coding journey.  
It takes two numbers and an operator as input and performs the correct calculation.

## Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Handles invalid inputs and division by zero

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Run the file using:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
Enter first number: 5
Enter the second number: 2
Enter an operator(+,-,/,*): *
The multiplication of 5 and 2 is 10
